## üß≠ Course Structure

The course is organized into **thematic units**, each including:

- üìò **Tutorials**: End-to-end machine learning pipelines for realistic problems.  
- üî¨ **Practicals**: Focused exercises for deepening understanding of specific models.  
- üåê **Web Applications**: Deployment of trained models using Flask.
